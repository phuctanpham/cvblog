I&nbsp;am Javascript fanita for both back-end architecture and modern front-end application. I have a strong know-how to be both an engineering manager and a markeing technologist. 

I&nbsp;work in a lean startup environment in the "customer centric" concept. Apart from building the tech startup culture, I use and extend **Agile**. I am both [Fundraiser](https://www.sggpnews.org.vn/startup-gcalls-with-1-million-post69280.html) and [Dreamer](https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/business/20160724/vietnamese-entrepreneurs-talk-culture-of-failure-to-local-startup-ecosystem/9844.html).

In 2023, I&nbsp;have started to be&nbsp; the consultant of M&A's deals in ICT Industry.

I'm open source and javascript enthusiast. That's why I'm a&nbsp;founder of the&nbsp;[jsViet](www.facebook.com/groups/jsviet.org/) community, which is a&nbsp;local community interested in Javascript' topics.
